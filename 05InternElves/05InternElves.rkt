Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

A nice string is one with all of the following properties:
    -It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or
     aeiouaeiouaeiou.
    -It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx,
     abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
    -It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part
     of one of the other requirements.

Year 2:
Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:
    -It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the
     string without overlapping, like xyxy (xy) or aabcdefgaa (aa), but not
     like aaa (aa, but it overlaps).
    -It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter
     between them, like xyx, abcdefeghi (efe), or even aaa.
