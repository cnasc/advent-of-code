#| Advent of Code 01: Not Quite Lisp
 |
 | Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he
 | can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing.
 | He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one
 | character at a time.
 |
 | An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing
 | parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.
